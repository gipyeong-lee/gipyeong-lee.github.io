description: Code version control is a process that allows software developers to keep track of changes to their source code. It allows them to easily roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong or if they need to make a change. Version control also allows multiple developers to work on the same code base without overwriting each other’s work.

# Introduction

Code version control is a process that allows software developers to keep track of changes to their source code. It allows them to easily roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong or if they need to make a change. Version control also allows multiple developers to work on the same code base without overwriting each other’s work.

Git is one of the most popular version control systems used by developers today. It’s fast, reliable, and provides a lot of features. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to use Git for code version control.

# Setup Git

Before you can start using Git, you’ll need to download and install it. You can find the download page at https://git-scm.com/downloads. Once you’ve downloaded the installer, just follow the instructions to complete the installation.

# Create a Repository

Once you’ve installed Git, you’ll need to create a repository. A repository is a collection of files and directories that are being tracked by Git. To create a repository, you’ll need to open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
git init
```

This will create a new repository in the current directory.

# Add Files to Repository

Now that you have a repository, you’ll need to add files to it. To add a file to the repository, you’ll need to run the following command:

```
git add <filename>
```

This will add the specified file to the repository. You can add multiple files at once by using the following command:

```
git add *.<extension>
```

This will add all files with the specified extension to the repository.

# Commit Changes

Once you’ve added files to the repository, you’ll need to commit your changes. To commit your changes, you’ll need to run the following command:

```
git commit -m “<message>”
```

This will commit all of your changes with the specified message.

# Push to Remote

Once you’ve committed your changes, you’ll need to push them to a remote repository. To do this, you’ll need to run the following command:

```
git push <remote> <branch>
```

This will push your changes to the specified remote repository and branch.

# Pull from Remote

If you need to pull changes from a remote repository, you can use the following command:

```
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

This will pull any changes from the specified remote repository and branch.

# Summary

Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track and manage changes to their source code. It’s fast, reliable, and provides a lot of features. In this article, we’ve taken a look at how to use Git for code version control.
