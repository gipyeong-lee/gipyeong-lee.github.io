 # Introduction

The world of technology is constantly evolving, and as engineers, it is important to stay up to date with the latest trends. One of the latest trends in technology is the use of Chatbots, which are computer programs that are designed to simulate conversations with human users. Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular, as they can provide a number of benefits to businesses, such as reducing customer service costs and automating tedious tasks. In this article, we will discuss how to build a chatbot, and the different technologies and tools available to help you do so.

# What is a Chatbot?

A Chatbot is a computer program that is designed to simulate conversation with human users. Chatbots can be used for a variety of purposes, such as customer service, product recommendations, and more. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to usersâ€™ input, and they can provide a number of advantages to businesses, such as providing faster customer service and automating tedious tasks.
