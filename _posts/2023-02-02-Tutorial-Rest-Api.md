# Introduction

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API is a web-based architecture that enables communication between different systems over the internet. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The REST API defines a set of functions that developers can use to perform requests and receive responses.

# What is a REST API?

REST API is an application programming interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. It is a web-based architecture that enables communication between different systems over the internet. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The REST API defines a set of functions that developers can use to perform requests and receive responses.

# How to Use a REST API

Using a REST API is simple. All you need to do is send an HTTP request to the API endpoint with the appropriate parameters. The API will then return a response in the form of an HTTP response code and a data payload.

The most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each of these methods has a specific purpose and is used to perform different types of operations.

# GET

The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. It is the most commonly used method and is used to retrieve data from a specific resource.

# POST

The POST method is used to create a new resource on the server. It is used to send data to the server and create a new resource.

# PUT

The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server. It is used to send data to the server and update an existing resource.

# DELETE

The DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server. It is used to send a request to the server to delete a specific resource.

# Conclusion

REST API is a powerful tool for developers to create web applications that can communicate with other systems over the internet. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other and is used to perform requests and receive responses. The most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each of these methods has a specific purpose and is used to perform different types of operations. With a REST API, developers can easily create web applications that can communicate with other systems.
