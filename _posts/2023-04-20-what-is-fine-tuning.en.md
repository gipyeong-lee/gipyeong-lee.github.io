# What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-Tuning is one of the training processes for artificial intelligence models, referring to the process of retraining an already trained model. It is used to further enhance the performance of a pre-trained model. This is achieved by adding new data to the existing model and readjusting the model's weights.

By using Fine-Tuning, you can improve the performance of a pre-trained model and obtain better prediction results. For example, let's assume there is a pre-trained image classification model. This model can already accurately classify various animal images such as dogs, cats, and deer. However, it cannot accurately classify new animal images. In this case, by using the Fine-Tuning technique to retrain the model including the new animal images, the model's performance can be improved to accurately classify the new animal images.

Fine-Tuning can be applied to various machine learning models. For instance, it can be used for both image classification models and natural language processing models. Furthermore, using Fine-Tuning allows for improving the performance of existing models and obtaining better prediction results. Therefore, it is important to appropriately utilize Fine-Tuning in the training process of artificial intelligence models.

# Advantages of Fine-Tuning in AI Models

In AI models, Fine-Tuning is a method used to improve the performance of deep learning models. Fine-Tuning involves conducting training on a new dataset based on an already trained model. This method possesses various advantages.

## Improvement in Speed and Accuracy

Fine-Tuning helps improve the model's speed and accuracy. This is because the dataset is sufficiently large and prepared accurately. Therefore, using Fine-Tuning allows the model to learn faster and more accurately.

## Reusability Between Models

Using Fine-Tuning allows for the reuse of data between models. This helps accelerate the model's training speed and improve its performance. For example, when training on a new dataset based on a pre-trained model, the weights of the pre-trained model can be reused to quickly train the new model.

## Training with Less Data

Fine-Tuning allows a model to be trained even when data is scarce. Therefore, model performance can be improved even with a small amount of data. For example, when training on a new dataset based on a pre-trained model, the performance of the model can be improved even with a small amount of data, even if the size of the new dataset is small.

## Summary

In AI models, Fine-Tuning is a method used to improve the performance of deep learning models. Fine-Tuning helps improve the speed and accuracy of the model, allows for the reuse of data between models, and can improve model performance even with a small amount of data. Therefore, Fine-Tuning is a very useful method for improving the performance of deep learning models.
