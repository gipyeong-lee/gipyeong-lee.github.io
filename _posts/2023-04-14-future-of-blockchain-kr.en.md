# Underlying Technologies of Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed network technology that uses a distributed database to store and manage data. This technology is used to securely store and manage data within a distributed network.

The underlying technologies of blockchain are as follows.

## Hash Functions

A hash function is a technology that converts input data into a fixed-length string. This function is used to detect changes in data and track modified parts. For example, in a blockchain network, hash functions generate a hash value of a block's content to protect it from being altered.

## Distributed Networks

A distributed network is a network that connects multiple computers to transmit, receive, and manage data. Blockchain networks are based on distributed networks and are used to securely store and manage data.

## Encryption Technology

Encryption technology is used to protect data by encrypting it. In blockchain networks, it is used to encrypt data to ensure security and prevent data tampering. For example, when storing a user's personal information on a blockchain network, encryption technology can be used to encrypt and protect the data.

## Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography is a technology that uses two keys to encrypt and decrypt data. It is used in blockchain networks to securely transmit data. For example, when transferring data in a blockchain network, public key cryptography allows for the data to be encrypted and decrypted for secure transmission.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are a contract technology used in blockchain networks. They are used to securely store and manage data. For example, when two users enter into an agreement on a blockchain network, a smart contract can be used to securely store and manage the terms of the contract.

The underlying technologies of blockchain include hash functions, distributed networks, encryption technology, public key cryptography, and smart contracts. These technologies are used to securely store and manage data in a blockchain network.

# Application Areas of Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed network based on distributed databases, with blockchains based on cryptocurrencies like Ethereum being a prime example. Blockchain is utilized in many application areas.

## Finance

Blockchain is widely used in the financial industry. Cryptocurrencies based on blockchain offer fast transaction speeds, low fees, and high security. Additionally, blockchain can be used to automate financial transactions and streamline information sharing. For example, blockchain can automate financial transactions such as bank transfers, deposits, and withdrawals.

## Security

Blockchain is also widely used in security applications. Blockchain strengthens security by distributing and encrypting data. Therefore, it is very useful for securely storing and managing passwords and authentication information. Furthermore, blockchain is highly effective in preventing data forgery and tampering.

## Media

Blockchain is widely used in the media sector as well. Using blockchain, copyrights and ownership of media content can be securely protected. Additionally, it allows content consumers to pay rewards directly to content providers. Thus, blockchain is very useful in the media industry for securely managing transactions between consumers and providers.

## Others

Blockchain is used in various other fields. It is utilized in healthcare, logistics, business, and other industries. For example, in logistics, blockchain is very useful for automating transactions and inventory management while enhancing security. In business, it helps automate contract and transaction management and strengthens security.

# The Future of Blockchain

Blockchain technology has been developing rapidly in recent years. Unlike traditional technologies, blockchain provides security and transparency based on a distributed network. It is being used in various fields such as finance, insurance, trading, transportation, and healthcare.

Blockchain technology is expected to develop further. It protects data through encryption technology and can automate various transactions via smart contracts. Moreover, blockchain enables faster and more efficient transactions compared to general networks. For example, blockchain technology allows financial transactions to be processed in real-time.

Blockchain technology is expected to be applied to even more fields in the future. It can be used to provide various services on the internet. Additionally, it enables faster and more secure transaction processing.

Blockchain technology can also be used in various industrial sectors. Better services can be provided in healthcare, education, government, and more by utilizing blockchain technology. It also offers improved security and privacy protection.

Blockchain technology is anticipated to advance further. It can be used in areas requiring security, transparency, and reliability. Furthermore, it can be used to deliver various services on the internet. Therefore, blockchain technology is expected to be applied to many more fields in the future.
