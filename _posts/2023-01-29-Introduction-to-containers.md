description: Containers are a form of virtualization that allow developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, developers can be sure that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any differences between the machines. This guarantees that the application will always run the same and makes the process of moving applications between different machines much easier.

## What are Containers?
Containers are a form of virtualization that allow developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, developers can be sure that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any differences between the machines. This guarantees that the application will always run the same and makes the process of moving applications between different machines much easier. 

## Benefits of Containers
Containers provide a number of benefits, including:

* **Portability**: Containers allow for applications to be easily moved between different machines or different cloud providers. This makes it easy to move applications from development to production or from one cloud provider to another.

* **Isolation**: Containers allow for applications to be isolated from each other and the host machine. This makes it easy to run multiple applications on the same host without them interfering with each other.

* **Scalability**: Containers allow for applications to be easily scaled up or down depending on demand. This makes it easy to manage the resources needed for an application and allows for applications to be quickly scaled up or down as needed.

* **Ease of Deployment**: Containers make it easy to deploy applications quickly and reliably. This makes it easy to deploy applications to different environments without having to worry about differences between machines.

## Container Runtime
In order to run containers, a container runtime is needed. There are a number of different container runtimes available, but the most popular one is Docker. Docker is an open source container runtime that allows for applications to be packaged up into containers and then run on any machine that has Docker installed. 

Docker works by packaging up an application and its dependencies into a container image. The container image can then be run on any machine that has Docker installed. Docker also provides a number of tools for managing containers and deploying them to different machines.

## Container Orchestration
Once containers are up and running, they need to be managed. This is where container orchestration comes in. Container orchestration is the process of managing multiple containers running on different machines. The most popular tool for container orchestration is Kubernetes, an open source project that allows for the management of multiple containers running on multiple machines.

Kubernetes provides a number of tools for managing containers, such as scheduling, scaling, and monitoring. Kubernetes also provides tools for deploying applications to different environments and managing the resources needed for an application.

## Conclusion
Containers are a powerful tool for developers and operations teams alike. They allow for applications to be easily moved between different machines and cloud providers, and they provide a number of benefits such as portability, isolation, scalability, and ease of deployment. In order to run containers, a container runtime such as Docker is needed. Once containers are running, they need to be managed, which is where container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes come in.
