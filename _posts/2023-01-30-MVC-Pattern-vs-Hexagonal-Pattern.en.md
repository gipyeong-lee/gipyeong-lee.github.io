# Introduction

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Hexagonal patterns are two of the most popular software design patterns. Both of these patterns are used to structure the code in an application, making it easier to maintain and extend. In this article, we will compare and contrast the two patterns, looking at their similarities and differences.

# MVC Pattern

The MVC pattern is one of the most widely used software design patterns. It is used to separate the application's data model from its user interface. The MVC pattern is composed of three components: the model, the view, and the controller.

The model is responsible for managing the application's data. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and manipulating the data. The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It is responsible for formatting the data and presenting it in a way that is easy to understand. The controller is responsible for responding to user input. It is responsible for handling user requests and updating the model and view accordingly.

# Hexagonal Pattern

The Hexagonal pattern is a software design pattern that is similar to the MVC pattern. It is composed of three components: the core, the adapter, and the interface.

The core is responsible for managing the application's data. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and manipulating the data. The adapter is responsible for connecting the core to the user interface. It is responsible for formatting the data and presenting it in a way that is easy to understand. The interface is responsible for responding to user input. It is responsible for handling user requests and updating the core and adapter accordingly.

# Comparison

The MVC and Hexagonal patterns are similar in that they both use three components to structure the code in an application. The main difference between the two patterns is the way in which the components are organized.

In the MVC pattern, the model, view, and controller are organized in a hierarchical structure. The model is at the top, followed by the view and then the controller. This structure makes it easy to maintain and extend the application.

In the Hexagonal pattern, the core, adapter, and interface are organized in a circular structure. The core is at the center, followed by the adapter and then the interface. This structure makes it easier to add new features to the application.

# Conclusion

The MVC and Hexagonal patterns are two of the most popular software design patterns. Both of these patterns are used to structure the code in an application, making it easier to maintain and extend. The main difference between the two patterns is the way in which the components are organized. The MVC pattern uses a hierarchical structure, while the Hexagonal pattern uses a circular structure.
